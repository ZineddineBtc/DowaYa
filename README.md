# DowaYa
An Android app that connects consumers to pharmacies.

## Features
Users can go through a list containing all of the medicines, and the pharmacies that provide those medicines.<br/>
Users can post medicines that they obtained from outside the country, or request medicines that they did not find in the list of medicines.<br/>

## Libraries and APIs
The app uses Firebase authentication and Firestore (NoSQL database). Also SQLite is used for offline database (bookmarks, history...).<br/>

## Future development
The app is mostly finished. The online database needs to be filled with medicines/pharmacies data.

## Probabilty of Further Development
Low.
