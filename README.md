# DowaYa
An Android app that connects consumers to pharmacies. (costumer side of DowaYa-Pharmacy repo)

Users can go through a list containing all of the medicines, and the pharmacies that provide those medicines.<br/>
Users can post medicines that they obtained from outside the country, or request medicines that they did not find in the list of medicines.<br/>

## Libraries and APIs
